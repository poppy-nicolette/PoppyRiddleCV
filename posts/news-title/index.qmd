## Summary

In this blog post, Poppy Riddle examines how OpenAlex and Crossref APIs handle key bibliographic metadata elements, focusing on differences in the reporting of abstracts and language attributes. By comparing outputs from the REST and XML endpoints, she highlights both the limitations and complementary strengths of these sources, encouraging researchers to leverage multiple APIs for a fuller and more nuanced picture of scholarly metadata.[link](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2025/09/29/xml-ementary-my-dear-watson-xml-ementary/)
